# Geo-Python

Introduction course to Python in French and German, with a special attention to problems related to geographical information.

The course is provided as a PDF file and is somewhat outdated. Currently there is a separate branch with a relacement Jupyter notebook taking the content from the PDF. Contributions are welcome.
